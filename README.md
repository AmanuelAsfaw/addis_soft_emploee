### Features implemented so far are:

- Project Setup with React Installations

## Built With

- React (A free and open-source front-end JavaScript and TypeScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components)
- Styled-Components (styled-components is the result of wondering how we could enhance CSS for styling React component systems.).
- Redux-Saga (It enable numerous approaches to tackling parallel execution, task concurrency, task racing, task cancellation, and more. Keep total control over the flow of your code.)

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

The basic requirements for building the executable are:

- A working browser application (Google chrome, Mozilla Fire fox, Microsoft edge ...)
- VSCode or any other equivalent code editor
- Node Package Manager (For installing packages like Lighthous, webhint & stylelint used for checking for debugging bad codes before deployment)
